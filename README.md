# A* implementation Python

This Project is an implementation of the A* algorithm in Python. This project includes a graphical interface to allow the user to create different paths and to examine how the A* algorithm traverses a grid. The F, G and H values used in each step is output to the user so that the user can follow along each step. Closed nodes are highlighted as red and open nodes are highlighted in Green. Each path starts at the top left of the map and finish in the bottom right.  

To create walls in the grid the user is able to click tiles turning them black. To start the A* search please press the SPACE key. The final path is highlighted in blue at the end of the search.
